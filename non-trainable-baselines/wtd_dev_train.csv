0,5_1,msgid870,1,Dev,what's green block one ok so ok so we know that green block one's heavier so ok blue block one looks relatively the same size so should we see,alright reese you can fill out the survey on the end over there ok so we know red block is ten grams
1,5_1,msgid866,1,Dev,what's green block one ok so ok so we know that green block one's heavier so ok blue block one looks relatively the same size so should we see,Where's the survey
2,5_2,msgid873,1,Dev,"i'd say red block, blue block's basically the same because it's teetering",so you hold that at the end of the scale yeah it goes here ok
3,5_2,msgid874,0,Dev,"i'd say red block, blue block's basically the same because it's teetering",so we know red block is ten set red block there for privacy
4,5_2,msgid877,1,Dev,"i'd say red block, blue block's basically the same because it's teetering",green block's heavy yep
5,5_3,msgid875,1,Dev,"ok so what if if i had red block, blue block is it one of yellow block, purple block, green block green block one",what's green block one ok so ok so we know that green block one's heavier so ok blue block one looks relatively the same size so should we see
6,5_3,msgid880,1,Dev,"ok so what if if i had red block, blue block is it one of yellow block, purple block, green block green block one","i'd say red block, blue block's basically the same because it's teetering"
7,5_3,msgid884,1,Dev,"ok so what if if i had red block, blue block is it one of yellow block, purple block, green block green block one","ok so yeah that scale so red block, blue block are both ten"
8,5_4,msgid897,1,Dev,Which one is heavier,purple block is heavier than green block one so green block is twenty purple block is heavier than green block one
9,5_4,msgid890,1,Dev,Which one is heavier,"so red block, blue block are both ten in theory ten ten twenty"
10,5_5,msgid895,1,Dev,purple block's greater than twenty,so the green we think is twenty ok so let's see we can use our hands as well
11,5_5,msgid897,0,Dev,purple block's greater than twenty,purple block is heavier than green block one so green block is twenty purple block is heavier than green block one
12,5_5,msgid900,1,Dev,purple block's greater than twenty,ok so let's try purple
13,5_6,msgid897,0,Dev,so i can put one one and see if purple block's thirty,purple block is heavier than green block one so green block is twenty purple block is heavier than green block one
14,5_6,msgid899,1,Dev,so i can put one one and see if purple block's thirty,yellow block is definitely the heaviest
15,5_6,msgid902,1,Dev,so i can put one one and see if purple block's thirty,So we have twenty
16,5_7,msgid898,1,Dev,"ok and then so if i take green block, red block one off yeah thirty put yellow block's going to be heavier more a thirty plus twenty",Which one is heavier
17,5_7,msgid903,1,Dev,"ok and then so if i take green block, red block one off yeah thirty put yellow block's going to be heavier more a thirty plus twenty",purple block's greater than twenty
18,5_7,msgid904,1,Dev,"ok and then so if i take green block, red block one off yeah thirty put yellow block's going to be heavier more a thirty plus twenty",so i can put one one and see if purple block's thirty
19,5_8,msgid924,1,Dev,So now we need to figure out just by holding them in our hands,i think yellow block is fifty and purple block is thirty
20,5_8,msgid925,1,Dev,So now we need to figure out just by holding them in our hands,i think yellow block's fifty
21,5_8,msgid941,1,Dev,So now we need to figure out just by holding them in our hands,Green was twenty yep nice
22,5_9,msgid890,0,Dev,Ok alright so what if we what if we this is eighty,"so red block, blue block are both ten in theory ten ten twenty"
23,5_9,msgid940,1,Dev,Ok alright so what if we what if we this is eighty,Fifty was yellow twenty was yeah we were right oh another block so we hit next on here
24,5_9,msgid942,1,Dev,Ok alright so what if we what if we this is eighty,So now we need to figure out just by holding them in our hands
25,5_10,msgid953,1,Dev,We'll have to add one of these and see,What if we flip it down there's a letter
26,5_10,msgid954,1,Dev,We'll have to add one of these and see,I would say this is still heavier I would say brown is still heavier than eighty
27,5_10,msgid964,1,Dev,We'll have to add one of these and see,This is a hundred
28,5_11,msgid967,1,Dev,Still heavier you think,We'll have to add one of these and see
29,5_11,msgid968,1,Dev,Still heavier you think,Maybe we'll try taking off the lighter of that block and do one ten under and then do that block and do one over
30,5_11,msgid981,1,Dev,Still heavier you think,I'd still say brown  
31,5_12,msgid978,1,Dev,What if we add one more and see if it's heavier,Add that to that add that
32,5_12,msgid981,0,Dev,What if we add one more and see if it's heavier,I'd still say brown  
33,5_12,msgid954,0,Dev,What if we add one more and see if it's heavier,I would say this is still heavier I would say brown is still heavier than eighty
34,5_13,msgid991,1,Dev,So we can you think one ten,Now I can tell that this is lighter than this one
35,5_13,msgid982,1,Dev,So we can you think one ten,Still heavier you think
36,5_13,msgid983,1,Dev,So we can you think one ten,The distribution's kind of off when you hold them not in a straight line
37,5_14,msgid1005,1,Dev,That's weird that or are we sure that purple is still twenty,We're good
38,5_14,msgid1007,1,Dev,That's weird that or are we sure that purple is still twenty,So it was ten ten twenty um so the hint is think about the relationship between the weights of the prior blocks and use that pattern to determine the weight of the mystery block it was ten ten twenty thirty fifty
39,5_14,msgid1012,1,Dev,That's weird that or are we sure that purple is still twenty,Yeah I mean that makes sense it would move here
40,5_15,msgid1010,1,Dev,If we decide to continue on the pattern,These are the same this is a difference of ten is this a difference of fifty no it is these and this
41,5_15,msgid1011,1,Dev,If we decide to continue on the pattern,So this plus this equals this 
42,5_15,msgid1012,0,Dev,If we decide to continue on the pattern,Yeah I mean that makes sense it would move here
43,5_1,msgid860,1,Dev,what's green block one ok so ok so we know that green block one's heavier so ok blue block one looks relatively the same size so should we see,No don't write it down you can flip that piece of paper over and uh you will be placing the blocks where they go on the sheet and you will also be filling out this survey here
44,5_1,msgid858,1,Dev,what's green block one ok so ok so we know that green block one's heavier so ok blue block one looks relatively the same size so should we see,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of the cubes in front of you
45,5_1,msgid874,1,Dev,what's green block one ok so ok so we know that green block one's heavier so ok blue block one looks relatively the same size so should we see,so we know red block is ten set red block there for privacy
46,5_2,msgid857,1,Dev,"i'd say red block, blue block's basically the same because it's teetering",The task you are completing today is called the weights task
47,5_2,msgid870,0,Dev,"i'd say red block, blue block's basically the same because it's teetering",alright reese you can fill out the survey on the end over there ok so we know red block is ten grams
48,5_2,msgid867,1,Dev,"i'd say red block, blue block's basically the same because it's teetering",It's on that computer
49,5_3,msgid874,0,Dev,"ok so what if if i had red block, blue block is it one of yellow block, purple block, green block green block one",so we know red block is ten set red block there for privacy
50,5_3,msgid867,0,Dev,"ok so what if if i had red block, blue block is it one of yellow block, purple block, green block green block one",It's on that computer
51,5_3,msgid883,1,Dev,"ok so what if if i had red block, blue block is it one of yellow block, purple block, green block green block one",yep it's an amazon scale we're fine
52,5_4,msgid886,1,Dev,Which one is heavier,Correct
53,5_4,msgid864,1,Dev,Which one is heavier,Um and you also don't need to touch the slider at all
54,5_4,msgid893,1,Dev,Which one is heavier,so we have there is no red
55,5_5,msgid877,0,Dev,purple block's greater than twenty,green block's heavy yep
56,5_5,msgid880,0,Dev,purple block's greater than twenty,"i'd say red block, blue block's basically the same because it's teetering"
57,5_5,msgid863,1,Dev,purple block's greater than twenty,Um the scale is not perfect and the blocks aren't always perfect so like it might teeter but that's fine if one drops that's like what you want to look for
58,5_6,msgid886,0,Dev,so i can put one one and see if purple block's thirty,Correct
59,5_6,msgid885,1,Dev,so i can put one one and see if purple block's thirty,"so red block, blue block are both ten"
60,5_6,msgid865,1,Dev,so i can put one one and see if purple block's thirty,Um so yeah just place the cubes on the worksheet as well as fill out the survey as you go and you guys can get started
61,5_7,msgid865,0,Dev,"ok and then so if i take green block, red block one off yeah thirty put yellow block's going to be heavier more a thirty plus twenty",Um so yeah just place the cubes on the worksheet as well as fill out the survey as you go and you guys can get started
62,5_7,msgid907,1,Dev,"ok and then so if i take green block, red block one off yeah thirty put yellow block's going to be heavier more a thirty plus twenty",what if i do this ok so less than forty likely thirty ok
63,5_7,msgid858,0,Dev,"ok and then so if i take green block, red block one off yeah thirty put yellow block's going to be heavier more a thirty plus twenty",In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of the cubes in front of you
64,5_8,msgid900,0,Dev,So now we need to figure out just by holding them in our hands,ok so let's try purple
65,5_8,msgid896,1,Dev,So now we need to figure out just by holding them in our hands,the green is twenty
66,5_8,msgid889,1,Dev,So now we need to figure out just by holding them in our hands,so green block one's twenty
67,5_9,msgid941,0,Dev,Ok alright so what if we what if we this is eighty,Green was twenty yep nice
68,5_9,msgid886,0,Dev,Ok alright so what if we what if we this is eighty,Correct
69,5_9,msgid895,0,Dev,Ok alright so what if we what if we this is eighty,so the green we think is twenty ok so let's see we can use our hands as well
70,5_10,msgid931,1,Dev,We'll have to add one of these and see,yeah that's fine
71,5_10,msgid892,1,Dev,We'll have to add one of these and see,yeah so we know the blue is ten yeah
72,5_10,msgid905,1,Dev,We'll have to add one of these and see,right what if we put ten on green block
73,5_11,msgid926,1,Dev,Still heavier you think,and then here let's confirm purple block a little this here
74,5_11,msgid861,1,Dev,Still heavier you think,can we write that down
75,5_11,msgid975,1,Dev,Still heavier you think,Ok cool
76,5_12,msgid889,0,Dev,What if we add one more and see if it's heavier,so green block one's twenty
77,5_12,msgid923,1,Dev,What if we add one more and see if it's heavier,Twenty
78,5_12,msgid916,1,Dev,What if we add one more and see if it's heavier,"yeah so i think fifty because green block, purple block is fifty right definitely less than sixty"
79,5_13,msgid918,1,Dev,So we can you think one ten,"and purple block is thirty right and red block is ten so purple block, red block would be forty so yellow block's more than forty and less than sixty so yellow block's gotta be fifty"
80,5_13,msgid979,1,Dev,So we can you think one ten,I would still say brown is heavier it might be a different way of measuring with the palm instead of your fingers but
81,5_13,msgid873,0,Dev,So we can you think one ten,so you hold that at the end of the scale yeah it goes here ok
82,5_14,msgid948,1,Dev,That's weird that or are we sure that purple is still twenty,Here
83,5_14,msgid1003,1,Dev,That's weird that or are we sure that purple is still twenty,That feels closer yeah ok alright so let's go put one ten down
84,5_14,msgid870,0,Dev,That's weird that or are we sure that purple is still twenty,alright reese you can fill out the survey on the end over there ok so we know red block is ten grams
85,5_15,msgid1027,1,Dev,If we decide to continue on the pattern,Eighty grams alright cool next ok
86,5_15,msgid952,1,Dev,If we decide to continue on the pattern,This is fifty
87,5_15,msgid959,1,Dev,If we decide to continue on the pattern,Yeah I agree I think
88,1_1,msgid27,1,Train,what would we maybe put blue block one on there too,just like put it on
89,1_1,msgid30,1,Train,what would we maybe put blue block one on there too,"red block, blue block seems pretty balanced"
90,1_1,msgid29,1,Train,what would we maybe put blue block one on there too,Hold on lets just uh
91,1_3,msgid79,1,Train,and green is twenty ok so which one is blue and which one is purple,"purple block, green block is fifty it's not"
92,1_3,msgid66,1,Train,and green is twenty ok so which one is blue and which one is purple,So what have we done weve done forty
93,1_3,msgid76,1,Train,and green is twenty ok so which one is blue and which one is purple,"so thirty purple block, blue block is also forty right so purple block, blue block if forty yeah"
94,1_4,msgid73,1,Train,yes verify real quick but i think purple block is,"thirty fourty fifty correct and purple block, green block's still heavier than yellow block thing"
95,1_4,msgid77,1,Train,yes verify real quick but i think purple block is,ok so green block one's twenty right
96,1_4,msgid76,0,Train,yes verify real quick but i think purple block is,"so thirty purple block, blue block is also forty right so purple block, blue block if forty yeah"
97,1_5,msgid89,1,Train,Yes do you want to check real quick,yes verify real quick but i think purple block is
98,1_5,msgid72,1,Train,Yes do you want to check real quick,"so purple block, green block is supposedly"
99,1_5,msgid75,1,Train,Yes do you want to check real quick,So have we done forty
100,1_6,msgid98,1,Train,How much was purple thirty,purple is thirty red is twenty yellow is fifty
101,1_6,msgid105,1,Train,How much was purple thirty,Ok definitely minimum fifty
102,1_7,msgid105,0,Train,I almost feel like this one is still heavier,Ok definitely minimum fifty
103,1_7,msgid108,1,Train,I almost feel like this one is still heavier,Yeah cause if you feel the yellow one oh yeah so yeah
104,1_8,msgid123,1,Train,This one feels heavier still add like ten to this side I think,I almost feel like this one is still heavier
105,1_8,msgid113,1,Train,This one feels heavier still add like ten to this side I think,Ok so we got this ok
106,1_8,msgid115,1,Train,This one feels heavier still add like ten to this side I think,How much was purple thirty
107,1_9,msgid124,1,Train,It still feels heavier but it could just be,This one feels heavier still add like ten to this side I think
108,1_9,msgid121,1,Train,It still feels heavier but it could just be,Yeah same point maybe
109,1_9,msgid113,0,Train,It still feels heavier but it could just be,Ok so we got this ok
110,1_10,msgid128,1,Train,Yeah that feels pretty pretty similar to me and try switching it left hand right hand maybe,So right now that's ninety grams
111,1_10,msgid121,0,Train,Yeah that feels pretty pretty similar to me and try switching it left hand right hand maybe,Yeah same point maybe
112,1_10,msgid110,1,Train,Yeah that feels pretty pretty similar to me and try switching it left hand right hand maybe,Definitely heavier
113,1_11,msgid127,1,Train,Two attempts a hundred will it tell us if we get it right or wrong ok,Our perception of it
114,1_11,msgid128,0,Train,Two attempts a hundred will it tell us if we get it right or wrong ok,So right now that's ninety grams
115,1_11,msgid129,1,Train,Two attempts a hundred will it tell us if we get it right or wrong ok,Oh jeez yeah
116,1_12,msgid154,1,Train,So would you,The thing that sucks is that now we are finding about like torque and different other
117,1_12,msgid160,1,Train,So would you,I wonder like I don't know what that one
118,2_1,msgid253,1,Train,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right,The first two are ten
119,2_1,msgid251,1,Train,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right,yeah so green block's probably twenty grams
120,2_1,msgid261,1,Train,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right,So you know twenty plus ten thirty probably
121,2_2,msgid275,1,Train,"wait did we mix purple block, green block up or",Oh not enough so probably
122,2_2,msgid272,1,Train,"wait did we mix purple block, green block up or","so purple block, green block's the twenty and the thirty"
123,2_2,msgid269,1,Train,"wait did we mix purple block, green block up or",You can do the same process with
124,2_3,msgid272,0,Train,blue or purple,"so purple block, green block's the twenty and the thirty"
125,2_3,msgid266,1,Train,blue or purple,i guess and there's no increment so five so we could probably just go with thirty on purple block
126,2_4,msgid283,1,Train,i think purple or,"so red block, blue block are both ten"
127,2_4,msgid278,1,Train,i think purple or,Oh yeah the twenty and the thirty so we'll go with the fifty
128,2_4,msgid275,0,Train,i think purple or,Oh not enough so probably
129,2_5,msgid281,1,Train,wait a mystery block,"wait did we mix purple block, green block up or"
130,2_5,msgid237,0,Train,wait a mystery block,"yeah red block, blue block also just look like relatively the same size but red block, blue block could be different material you know"
131,2_5,msgid275,0,Train,wait a mystery block,Oh not enough so probably
132,2_6,msgid305,1,Train,Do you want to give it a shot,Ok so this block is heavier than our fifty
133,2_6,msgid299,1,Train,Do you want to give it a shot,Without the scale
134,2_6,msgid290,1,Train,Do you want to give it a shot,Question was asked
135,2_7,msgid324,1,Train,Is the can the weight exceed what's on the paper,I think it's a bit more than the max
136,2_7,msgid325,1,Train,Is the can the weight exceed what's on the paper,So yeah probably maybe one forty plus or minus ten
137,2_7,msgid327,1,Train,Is the can the weight exceed what's on the paper,Actually either one thirty
138,2_8,msgid327,0,Train,Is it wrong,Actually either one thirty
139,2_8,msgid328,1,Train,Is it wrong,Is the can the weight exceed what's on the paper
140,2_8,msgid322,1,Train,Is it wrong,I might shoot all the way for the one forty
141,2_9,msgid335,1,Train,So we can try and,Honestly I still feel like we should go with one forty first and if not we should actually move to one thirty
142,2_9,msgid321,1,Train,So we can try and,So it's probably
143,2_9,msgid322,0,Train,So we can try and,I might shoot all the way for the one forty
144,2_10,msgid365,1,Train,Were we right then,This set of two adds up to this one and then the next set of two adds up to that
145,2_10,msgid367,1,Train,Were we right then,So it would be eighty and you weigh less
146,2_11,msgid367,0,Train,No you're wrong it was eighty,So it would be eighty and you weigh less
147,2_11,msgid369,1,Train,No you're wrong it was eighty,I think it's just the last two so it would just be fifty and thirty
148,2_12,msgid365,0,Train,And then like every set of two I guess and the next block will be the set,This set of two adds up to this one and then the next set of two adds up to that
149,2_12,msgid367,0,Train,And then like every set of two I guess and the next block will be the set,So it would be eighty and you weigh less
150,2_12,msgid374,1,Train,And then like every set of two I guess and the next block will be the set,No you're wrong it was eighty
151,2_13,msgid365,0,Train,Least heavy to most heavy or,This set of two adds up to this one and then the next set of two adds up to that
152,2_13,msgid367,0,Train,Least heavy to most heavy or,So it would be eighty and you weigh less
153,2_13,msgid369,0,Train,Least heavy to most heavy or,I think it's just the last two so it would just be fifty and thirty
154,3_1,msgid412,1,Train,"so you think red block, blue block're the same weight or",prepare things for red block one
155,3_1,msgid411,1,Train,"so you think red block, blue block're the same weight or",Alright so shall we
156,3_1,msgid231,1,Train,"so you think red block, blue block're the same weight or",Ok cool no for sure
157,3_2,msgid426,1,Train,yellow block one feels just a smidge heavier yeah try green block one,so i should indicate blue block as ten
158,3_2,msgid430,1,Train,yellow block one feels just a smidge heavier yeah try green block one,yes green block's probably twenty so green one is twenty
159,3_4,msgid446,1,Train,wait purple is how much purple was thirty,green is twenty and purple is thirty so yellow block weighs to fifty
160,3_4,msgid445,1,Train,wait purple is how much purple was thirty,green and purple block one
161,3_4,msgid444,1,Train,wait purple is how much purple was thirty,green is twenty right
162,3_5,msgid457,1,Train,"have we tried red block, blue block two and the green one cause it's",yellow is of course not ten but
163,3_5,msgid444,0,Train,"have we tried red block, blue block two and the green one cause it's",green is twenty right
164,3_6,msgid446,0,Train,"no so when we try purple block, green block both",green is twenty and purple is thirty so yellow block weighs to fifty
165,3_6,msgid452,1,Train,"no so when we try purple block, green block both",then green is twenty and they weigh
166,3_6,msgid460,1,Train,"no so when we try purple block, green block both","have we tried red block, blue block two and the green one cause it's"
167,3_7,msgid466,1,Train,"yellow block must be red block, blue block, purple block right because comparing yellow block to forty yellow block's","purple block, green block has thirty and twenty"
168,3_7,msgid446,0,Train,"yellow block must be red block, blue block, purple block right because comparing yellow block to forty yellow block's",green is twenty and purple is thirty so yellow block weighs to fifty
169,3_7,msgid451,1,Train,"yellow block must be red block, blue block, purple block right because comparing yellow block to forty yellow block's",so how about yellow
170,3_8,msgid471,1,Train,maybe we should try those things here,"yellow block must be red block, blue block, purple block right because comparing yellow block to forty yellow block's"
171,3_8,msgid446,0,Train,maybe we should try those things here,green is twenty and purple is thirty so yellow block weighs to fifty
172,3_8,msgid466,0,Train,maybe we should try those things here,"purple block, green block has thirty and twenty"
173,3_9,msgid491,1,Train,Is there a way for us to test it other than just our,Oh fun
174,3_9,msgid469,1,Train,Is there a way for us to test it other than just our,so if you put the purple and just to verify that all of our weights are correct
175,3_10,msgid506,1,Train,I have a question ok somebody like hold the yellow and the brown like,Is it twice as heavy as the yellow one I can't tell
176,3_10,msgid502,1,Train,I have a question ok somebody like hold the yellow and the brown like,I think it is between ninety to a hundred
177,3_10,msgid511,1,Train,I have a question ok somebody like hold the yellow and the brown like,I think it's between eighty and ninety
178,3_11,msgid514,1,Train,But like tell me when it starts to feel the same,This is heavier I can
179,3_11,msgid506,0,Train,But like tell me when it starts to feel the same,Is it twice as heavy as the yellow one I can't tell
180,3_11,msgid502,0,Train,But like tell me when it starts to feel the same,I think it is between ninety to a hundred
181,3_12,msgid502,0,Train,How do you feel this one is lighter,I think it is between ninety to a hundred
182,3_12,msgid505,1,Train,How do you feel this one is lighter,Maybe a hundred or so
183,3_13,msgid511,0,Train,I feel like this like might be a smidge heavier but,I think it's between eighty and ninety
184,3_13,msgid519,1,Train,I feel like this like might be a smidge heavier but,I think it is ok now
185,3_13,msgid514,0,Train,I feel like this like might be a smidge heavier but,This is heavier I can
186,3_14,msgid511,0,Train,Definitely heavier right,I think it's between eighty and ninety
187,3_14,msgid529,1,Train,Definitely heavier right,Now I feel like the right side
188,3_15,msgid517,1,Train,Does uh like heavier objects roll down the incline plane faster,I think yeah it does
189,3_15,msgid519,0,Train,Does uh like heavier objects roll down the incline plane faster,I think it is ok now
190,3_15,msgid525,1,Train,Does uh like heavier objects roll down the incline plane faster,I feel like this like might be a smidge heavier but
191,3_16,msgid537,1,Train,Does this really heavier than this for sure,Does uh like heavier objects roll down the incline plane faster
192,3_16,msgid525,0,Train,Does this really heavier than this for sure,I feel like this like might be a smidge heavier but
193,3_16,msgid529,0,Train,Does this really heavier than this for sure,Now I feel like the right side
194,3_17,msgid575,1,Train,What if,So now it's leaning this way if we put that it's leaning this way ninety
195,3_17,msgid574,1,Train,What if,I'm thinking to just remove this once
196,3_17,msgid572,1,Train,What if,If you have like if you keep twenty
197,3_18,msgid568,0,Train,So then theory do we have these positioned the same,It's eighty
198,3_18,msgid575,0,Train,So then theory do we have these positioned the same,So now it's leaning this way if we put that it's leaning this way ninety
199,3_18,msgid577,1,Train,So then theory do we have these positioned the same,What if
200,3_19,msgid577,0,Train,What if you removed the ten,What if
201,3_19,msgid441,1,Train,What if you removed the ten,blue block is blue maybe
202,3_19,msgid591,1,Train,What if you removed the ten,If only our block was a little just narrow sliver
203,3_20,msgid592,1,Train,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right,What if you removed the ten
204,3_20,msgid587,1,Train,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right,It's nintey see even for that its
205,3_20,msgid590,1,Train,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right,Here it started dipping
206,3_21,msgid599,1,Train,Yeah it's maybe let's try it with the smaller one then,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right
207,3_21,msgid592,0,Train,Yeah it's maybe let's try it with the smaller one then,What if you removed the ten
208,3_22,msgid592,0,Train,Do we want to say eighty,What if you removed the ten
209,3_22,msgid593,1,Train,Do we want to say eighty,I think it's eighty now
210,3_22,msgid413,1,Train,Do we want to say eighty,Yeah
211,3_23,msgid601,1,Train,Are we allowed to use,Is it ok
212,3_23,msgid603,1,Train,Are we allowed to use,Yeah it's maybe let's try it with the smaller one then
213,3_23,msgid604,1,Train,Are we allowed to use,Just to test like
214,3_24,msgid614,1,Train,Ok so we literally know nothing about the second block this sounds like a Bayesian probability question right,Uh there's a scale
215,3_24,msgid610,1,Train,Ok so we literally know nothing about the second block this sounds like a Bayesian probability question right,Do we want to say eighty
216,3_24,msgid612,1,Train,Ok so we literally know nothing about the second block this sounds like a Bayesian probability question right,Yeah it's too balanced
217,3_25,msgid635,1,Train,Every possible weight up to one forty you think so we got ,So it must be a set so we should be able to make every possible weight here with these blocks they have one fifty two
218,3_25,msgid629,1,Train,Every possible weight up to one forty you think so we got ,The second yes yeah so we have to use only this
219,3_25,msgid630,1,Train,Every possible weight up to one forty you think so we got ,Well I assume we can use the second the first mystery block as a data point
220,3_26,msgid658,1,Train,If we just used only two blocks then,Whatever like how did we guess eighty like we used only two blocks even for measurement of everything we just used two blocks so I'm thinking
221,3_26,msgid643,1,Train,If we just used only two blocks then,We have ten two tens we have twenty we have thirty we can make forty with these three we can we have fifty
222,3_26,msgid642,1,Train,If we just used only two blocks then,Ok yeah eighty plus fifty fifty and then yeah ok
223,6_1,msgid1073,1,Train,Alright let's see if we can find a thirty,Alright let's see if we can find a twenty
224,6_1,msgid1075,1,Train,Alright let's see if we can find a thirty,Way too heavy
225,6_1,msgid1077,1,Train,Alright let's see if we can find a thirty,Looks like about twenty
226,6_2,msgid1083,1,Train,cause purple block's also a twenty let's double check that purple block's not also a twenty,making sure that purple block didn't have the weight at the bottom
227,6_2,msgid1084,1,Train,cause purple block's also a twenty let's double check that purple block's not also a twenty,"it's just stuff written at the bottom that's a so red block, green block's a ten and a twenty right now right that's looking"
228,6_2,msgid1086,1,Train,cause purple block's also a twenty let's double check that purple block's not also a twenty,"red block, blue block, green block, yellow block, purple block're increments of ten i would say that's probably"
229,6_3,msgid1073,0,Train,is blue block one a twenty,Alright let's see if we can find a twenty
230,6_3,msgid1077,0,Train,is blue block one a twenty,Looks like about twenty
231,6_3,msgid1088,1,Train,is blue block one a twenty,cause purple block's also a twenty let's double check that purple block's not also a twenty
232,6_4,msgid1080,1,Train,so i would guess the yellow one is gonna be,so yellow block one is noticeably heavier than
233,6_4,msgid1083,0,Train,so i would guess the yellow one is gonna be,making sure that purple block didn't have the weight at the bottom
234,6_4,msgid1094,1,Train,so i would guess the yellow one is gonna be,"if red block, blue block, green block, yellow block, purple block're only in increments of ten purple block has to be"
235,6_5,msgid1088,0,Train,"yeah purple block, green block's considerably heavier so purple block one did we say purple block was thirty",cause purple block's also a twenty let's double check that purple block's not also a twenty
236,6_5,msgid1092,1,Train,"yeah purple block, green block's considerably heavier so purple block one did we say purple block was thirty",ok so purple block's more than twenty but it almost seems like the thirty takes it past but
237,6_5,msgid1095,1,Train,"yeah purple block, green block's considerably heavier so purple block one did we say purple block was thirty",i think yeah purple block has to be thirty purple block
238,6_6,msgid1109,1,Train,"did we try forty we did try forty because green block one's thirty and then blue block one's or green block one's twenty so purple block, blue block","but green block, purple block's too heavy"
239,6_6,msgid1108,1,Train,"did we try forty we did try forty because green block one's thirty and then blue block one's or green block one's twenty so purple block, blue block",yellow block's definitely not thirty so yellow block has to
240,6_8,msgid1139,1,Train,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be,Is it heavy
241,6_8,msgid1133,1,Train,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be,so red was ten yellow was fifty we're great
242,6_8,msgid1138,1,Train,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be,Fun oh boy
243,6_9,msgid1145,1,Train,Are we allowed to make our own scales is there rules,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be
244,6_9,msgid1139,0,Train,Are we allowed to make our own scales is there rules,Is it heavy
245,6_10,msgid1145,0,Train,Or are you not allowed to tell us what we are allowed to do,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be
246,6_10,msgid1146,1,Train,Or are you not allowed to tell us what we are allowed to do,Are we allowed to make our own scales is there rules
247,6_10,msgid1139,0,Train,Or are you not allowed to tell us what we are allowed to do,Is it heavy
248,6_11,msgid1157,1,Train,Which ones twenty this one,Oh that's a heavy one
249,6_11,msgid1072,0,Train,Which ones twenty this one,i would agree yeah so blue block one's ten
250,6_11,msgid1151,1,Train,Which ones twenty this one,I like your idea
251,6_12,msgid1173,1,Train,I think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say,That felt to me like it was heavier than all of those
252,6_12,msgid1174,1,Train,I think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say,So it's gotta be like a like heavier so it's over one twenty we know that so it's over one twenty
253,6_12,msgid1162,1,Train,I think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say,Um yeah
254,6_13,msgid1174,0,Train,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up,So it's gotta be like a like heavier so it's over one twenty we know that so it's over one twenty
255,6_13,msgid1175,1,Train,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up,I think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say
256,6_13,msgid1178,1,Train,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up,Well and it could be past the end of sheet if they're trying to be tricky
257,6_14,msgid1174,0,Train,How much is the yellow one again,So it's gotta be like a like heavier so it's over one twenty we know that so it's over one twenty
258,6_14,msgid1179,1,Train,How much is the yellow one again,Yeah she gives us up to one fifty on our survey
259,6_14,msgid1180,1,Train,How much is the yellow one again,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up
260,6_15,msgid1180,0,Train,Do you know how much the coffee weighs though,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up
261,6_15,msgid1183,1,Train,Do you know how much the coffee weighs though,Drink enough coffee until it weighs the weight is
262,6_15,msgid1185,1,Train,Do you know how much the coffee weighs though,How much is the yellow one again
263,6_16,msgid1189,1,Train,I wonder if we can guess it's similar in weight to these three,We have one twenty we got at least forty so I would say one sixty
264,6_16,msgid1197,1,Train,I wonder if we can guess it's similar in weight to these three,That's definitely our only options
265,6_16,msgid1196,1,Train,I wonder if we can guess it's similar in weight to these three,See if some of these blocks weigh similar to my coffee
266,6_17,msgid1213,1,Train,What do you guys think that makes sense yeah,So what do you have there two hundred
267,6_17,msgid1224,1,Train,What do you guys think that makes sense yeah,Fifty thirty eighty
268,6_18,msgid1224,0,Train,Are you guys good with eighty,Fifty thirty eighty
269,6_18,msgid1223,1,Train,Are you guys good with eighty,Ten and ten make twenty ten and twenty make thirty twenty thirty fifty
270,6_18,msgid1218,1,Train,Are you guys good with eighty,Ah think of a pattern
271,8_2,msgid1742,1,Train,can i add the red one or blue one here maybe purple block might be thirty,"i'll just take red block, blue block off and then we can have a little more"
272,8_2,msgid1739,1,Train,can i add the red one or blue one here maybe purple block might be thirty,or is green block
273,8_2,msgid1740,1,Train,can i add the red one or blue one here maybe purple block might be thirty,yeah green is for twenty
274,8_3,msgid1750,1,Train,did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might,"i mean the fact that it's teetering back and forth it's close enough red block, blue block, green block, yellow block, purple block're just increments of ten grams"
275,8_3,msgid1746,1,Train,did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might,can i add the red one or blue one here maybe purple block might be thirty
276,8_3,msgid1739,0,Train,did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might,or is green block
277,8_4,msgid1746,0,Train,let's try both the green ones now i mean both the big ones yeah,can i add the red one or blue one here maybe purple block might be thirty
278,8_4,msgid1748,1,Train,let's try both the green ones now i mean both the big ones yeah,so twenty purple block's thirty
279,8_4,msgid1750,0,Train,let's try both the green ones now i mean both the big ones yeah,"i mean the fact that it's teetering back and forth it's close enough red block, blue block, green block, yellow block, purple block're just increments of ten grams"
280,8_5,msgid1772,1,Train,But which one was thirty I'm just,green green is twenty so green is twenty and then we said purple block one is thirty right
281,8_5,msgid1768,1,Train,But which one was thirty I'm just,purple block is twenty or thirty
282,8_5,msgid1765,1,Train,But which one was thirty I'm just,what if we do the green one and the two smaller cubes
283,8_6,msgid1791,1,Train,Like can we use a combination of,But we don't and less than fifty actually
284,8_6,msgid1793,1,Train,Like can we use a combination of,Twenty plus ten thirty
285,8_6,msgid1789,1,Train,Like can we use a combination of,So what if we do
286,8_7,msgid1801,1,Train,"so we can move one of red block, blue block, purple block",yeah yellow block is between forty and fifty
287,8_7,msgid1793,0,Train,"so we can move one of red block, blue block, purple block",Twenty plus ten thirty
288,8_8,msgid1801,0,Train,we know yellow block's between forty and fifty we can't really,yeah yellow block is between forty and fifty
289,8_8,msgid1799,1,Train,we know yellow block's between forty and fifty we can't really,Fifty is too heavy
290,8_9,msgid1801,0,Train,directly compare yellow block um,yeah yellow block is between forty and fifty
291,8_9,msgid1799,0,Train,directly compare yellow block um,Fifty is too heavy
292,8_9,msgid1804,1,Train,directly compare yellow block um,we tried all of the combinations yeah yeah we can try this
293,8_10,msgid1812,1,Train,where should we put yellow block then in forty,actually just adding one gram made it equal
294,8_10,msgid1814,1,Train,where should we put yellow block then in forty,oh yeah cause it's a scale yeah so
295,8_10,msgid1807,1,Train,where should we put yellow block then in forty,we know yellow block's between forty and fifty we can't really
296,8_11,msgid1807,0,Train,presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure yellow block accurately,we know yellow block's between forty and fifty we can't really
297,8_11,msgid1809,1,Train,presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure yellow block accurately,Cause everything else we know is like a multiple of ten so we just can't
298,8_11,msgid1812,0,Train,presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure yellow block accurately,actually just adding one gram made it equal
299,8_12,msgid1812,0,Train,wait so is green block just in the wrong place or is green block the twenty,actually just adding one gram made it equal
300,8_12,msgid1807,0,Train,wait so is green block just in the wrong place or is green block the twenty,we know yellow block's between forty and fifty we can't really
301,8_12,msgid1800,1,Train,wait so is green block just in the wrong place or is green block the twenty,"i mean it could be just like how red block, blue block, green block were placed on like measured at like i don't know"
302,8_14,msgid1812,0,Train,would you agree with that,actually just adding one gram made it equal
303,8_14,msgid1816,0,Train,would you agree with that,so yellow block's forty one
304,8_14,msgid1824,1,Train,would you agree with that,is green block in the wrong place or is green block ok so purple block is thirty fifty minus one so
305,8_15,msgid1821,1,Train,Should we be precise to one gram,presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure yellow block accurately
306,8_15,msgid1829,1,Train,Should we be precise to one gram,ok so yellow block's probably meant to be just fifty and was placed differently
307,8_15,msgid1836,1,Train,Should we be precise to one gram,should we double check anything or just assume that we got it
308,8_16,msgid1829,0,Train,So you want to just like tell me the numbers cause,ok so yellow block's probably meant to be just fifty and was placed differently
309,8_16,msgid1825,1,Train,So you want to just like tell me the numbers cause,shall we try that no it's twenty yeah one no not minus one minus nine
310,8_16,msgid1822,1,Train,So you want to just like tell me the numbers cause,wait so is green block just in the wrong place or is green block the twenty
311,8_17,msgid1846,1,Train,yeah and and um what's the other one blue blue is ten,so yellow is fifty they said yellow's cause it was forty so yellow's fifty green is twenty
312,8_17,msgid1829,0,Train,yeah and and um what's the other one blue blue is ten,ok so yellow block's probably meant to be just fifty and was placed differently
313,8_17,msgid1825,0,Train,yeah and and um what's the other one blue blue is ten,shall we try that no it's twenty yeah one no not minus one minus nine
314,8_18,msgid1856,1,Train,mystery block,White block
315,8_18,msgid1846,0,Train,mystery block,so yellow is fifty they said yellow's cause it was forty so yellow's fifty green is twenty
316,8_19,msgid1839,1,Train,Is there any mystery block third weight,should we tenths length ok that's fine yeah
317,8_19,msgid1837,1,Train,Is there any mystery block third weight,Should we be precise to one gram
318,8_19,msgid1750,0,Train,Is there any mystery block third weight,"i mean the fact that it's teetering back and forth it's close enough red block, blue block, green block, yellow block, purple block're just increments of ten grams"
319,8_20,msgid1871,1,Train,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference,I mean we could use a combination of these
320,8_20,msgid1875,1,Train,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference,Um and if you notice they all have this kind of stuff written on them so maybe this is
321,8_20,msgid1872,1,Train,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference,Actually since the like the density is different we can't actually compare directly
322,8_21,msgid1892,1,Train,Want me to add the green,Can you add a ten for me 
323,8_21,msgid1877,1,Train,Want me to add the green,Well they all say the same thing
324,8_21,msgid1883,1,Train,Want me to add the green,We can feel a hole right here so maybe we can see how much is drilled out as well
325,8_22,msgid1893,1,Train,A way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference
326,8_22,msgid1889,1,Train,A way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel,Or let's all like do what he's doing
327,8_22,msgid1892,0,Train,A way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel,Can you add a ten for me 
328,8_23,msgid1899,1,Train,Are they the same size though,Lowkey add a ten
329,8_23,msgid1909,1,Train,Are they the same size though,Uh it's this one we want now
330,8_25,msgid1924,1,Train,So it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple,So we said like green was ten green was twenty
331,8_25,msgid1925,1,Train,So it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple,Fifty plus
332,8_25,msgid1929,1,Train,So it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple,Yellow was fifty
333,8_26,msgid1947,1,Train,Ninety let's see are we good with ninety,Purple and a yellow green
334,8_26,msgid1965,1,Train,Ninety let's see are we good with ninety,Added a ten
335,8_26,msgid1945,1,Train,Ninety let's see are we good with ninety,So it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple
336,8_27,msgid1976,1,Train,Is it the second mystery block,Uh it was eighty yep
337,8_27,msgid1981,1,Train,Is it the second mystery block,If you were to add another ten pounds to make it a hundred it would have definitely tilted over
338,8_28,msgid1981,0,Train,A second mystery block so I'm just wondering which two are moving about,If you were to add another ten pounds to make it a hundred it would have definitely tilted over
339,8_28,msgid1974,1,Train,A second mystery block so I'm just wondering which two are moving about,It was about ready to fall but it didn't fall it needed to be touched so maybe it was a hundred
340,8_29,msgid1989,1,Train,We don't have a mystery block the company forgot to send the block when you do estimate what the mystery block's weight was without knowing,There is no mystery block but we need to estimate the weight of it
341,8_29,msgid1997,1,Train,We don't have a mystery block the company forgot to send the block when you do estimate what the mystery block's weight was without knowing,Create the wooden block do not send we have to
342,8_30,msgid1995,1,Train,What do you think,A second mystery block so I'm just wondering which two are moving about
343,8_30,msgid1988,1,Train,What do you think,Just right there
344,8_30,msgid1986,1,Train,What do you think,Is it the second mystery block
345,8_31,msgid2018,1,Train,For like each new block,Each block is the sum of the heaviest two
346,8_31,msgid2000,1,Train,For like each new block,Even knowing what it is
347,8_31,msgid2001,1,Train,For like each new block,My estimate was like we have two tens when we add two tens we get a twenty when you get twenty plus ten we get a thirty
348,9_1,msgid2099,1,Train,I don't know if I trust you,Maybe
349,9_1,msgid2098,1,Train,I don't know if I trust you,It's heavier than this too as well
350,9_2,msgid2102,1,Train,What it's eighty grams I feel like it's ,Maybe it will right I'm not sure
351,9_2,msgid2107,1,Train,What it's eighty grams I feel like it's ,Yeah I feel like oh we got all the way up to like one forty ok just kidding I thought it was just up to seventy I was like we'll just go with our maximum
352,9_3,msgid2124,1,Train,Like no shot this is eighty grams,What it's eighty grams I feel like it's 
353,9_3,msgid2111,1,Train,Like no shot this is eighty grams,I'd say it's probably at least one forty
354,9_3,msgid2120,1,Train,Like no shot this is eighty grams,So we were wrong I guess then one fifty
355,10_1,msgid2176,1,Train,let's assume that the bigger ones are,Yeah
356,10_1,msgid2166,1,Train,let's assume that the bigger ones are,Oh okay
357,10_1,msgid2167,1,Train,let's assume that the bigger ones are,Sorry
358,10_2,msgid2179,1,Train,"i mean what why didn't we first check out whether red block, blue block two are equal red block, blue block are of equal size but",let's assume that the bigger ones are
359,10_2,msgid2180,1,Train,"i mean what why didn't we first check out whether red block, blue block two are equal red block, blue block are of equal size but",let's put two yeah red one as well
360,10_2,msgid2185,1,Train,"i mean what why didn't we first check out whether red block, blue block two are equal red block, blue block are of equal size but","i guess green block is like twenty and red block, blue block is like ten and ten"
361,10_4,msgid2211,1,Train,"do green block, purple block, yellow block make sense",cause i have a feeling purple block is a little more
362,10_4,msgid2217,1,Train,"do green block, purple block, yellow block make sense","i'm guessing it's a little bit to the left a little bit to the left like it touches the red line but on the left hand side of the left line red red block, blue block, green block's gonna be heavier like not equal but almost almost equal how do wait how do we know green block one's twenty did we no we didn't"
363,10_4,msgid2218,1,Train,"do green block, purple block, yellow block make sense",yeah so let's try to put blue block on top and see okay so it's definitely not like fourty like thirty two thirty three what do you say cause green block one's twenty red block one's ten cause we did it
364,10_5,msgid2225,1,Train,Do you wanna try any tens anywhere,What's left
365,10_5,msgid2166,0,Train,Do you wanna try any tens anywhere,Oh okay
366,10_5,msgid2223,1,Train,Do you wanna try any tens anywhere,So okay Cool
367,10_6,msgid2228,1,Train,"like if green block, purple block are more than fifty then yellow block is less yeah",so purple block one's thirty and what's green block one twenty right twenty okay so yellow block one's gonna be fifty okay
368,10_6,msgid2221,1,Train,"like if green block, purple block are more than fifty then yellow block is less yeah",to begin with also like we don't really have time to do this
369,10_6,msgid2219,1,Train,"like if green block, purple block are more than fifty then yellow block is less yeah",we we moved green block and checked the two tens remember we didn't do green block one okay yeah sure sure sure yeah yeah put thirty thirty yeah
370,10_7,msgid2237,1,Train,should i oh yeah yellow block is fifty grams,just a sec let this settle now yeah
371,10_7,msgid2228,0,Train,should i oh yeah yellow block is fifty grams,so purple block one's thirty and what's green block one twenty right twenty okay so yellow block one's gonna be fifty okay
372,10_7,msgid2241,1,Train,should i oh yeah yellow block is fifty grams,"like if green block, purple block are more than fifty then yellow block is less yeah"
373,10_8,msgid2268,1,Train,"you know what like i feel that is blue block, red block what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right",purple's purple block one thirty
374,10_8,msgid2267,1,Train,"you know what like i feel that is blue block, red block what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right",blue and reds well they don't have the right uh purple thirty right yeah alright let's do it
375,10_8,msgid2266,1,Train,"you know what like i feel that is blue block, red block what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right",tens tens are blue blue and red yup
376,10_9,msgid2262,1,Train,where is the mystery block any idea,so the yellow one's fifty yeah green wait green's twenty
377,10_9,msgid2276,1,Train,where is the mystery block any idea,green is twenty i mean we're we're right right i mean we're exactly right
378,10_9,msgid2278,1,Train,where is the mystery block any idea,no the red is ten blue is ten yellow is fifty okay
379,10_10,msgid2259,1,Train,indicate the weight of the mystery block whoa where is the blue guy,Ten I guess
380,10_10,msgid2263,1,Train,indicate the weight of the mystery block whoa where is the blue guy,Fifty Yeah Twenty
381,10_10,msgid2269,1,Train,indicate the weight of the mystery block whoa where is the blue guy,"you know what like i feel that is blue block, red block what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right"
382,10_11,msgid2282,1,Train,"i would say still heavier than all mystery block blocks yeah can you grab there and hold red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block",you have two attempts mystery block's heavier than everything else
383,10_11,msgid2281,1,Train,"i would say still heavier than all mystery block blocks yeah can you grab there and hold red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block",indicate the weight of the mystery block whoa where is the blue guy
384,10_11,msgid2278,0,Train,"i would say still heavier than all mystery block blocks yeah can you grab there and hold red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block",no the red is ten blue is ten yellow is fifty okay
385,10_12,msgid2313,1,Train,"because two tens two tens there's two so the thing is like if we put yellow block, purple block, green block, red block also feels lighter right","like like wait let's remove red block, blue block two let's check yellow block, purple block, green block one is lighter right on the right side"
386,10_12,msgid2302,1,Train,"because two tens two tens there's two so the thing is like if we put yellow block, purple block, green block, red block also feels lighter right",Suppose I remove the tens ones then
387,10_12,msgid2304,1,Train,"because two tens two tens there's two so the thing is like if we put yellow block, purple block, green block, red block also feels lighter right","how are you how are you really holding i'm just moving blocks and seeing yeah red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block is lighter red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block is lighter if i put the ten"
388,10_13,msgid2313,0,Train,"red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block, mystery block feels same almost try it","like like wait let's remove red block, blue block two let's check yellow block, purple block, green block one is lighter right on the right side"
389,10_13,msgid2317,1,Train,"red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block, mystery block feels same almost try it","how much is yellow block, purple block, green block so we have fifty thirty eighty ten hundred hundred and twenty"
390,10_13,msgid2330,1,Train,"red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block, mystery block feels same almost try it",i i was thinking maybe a little bit higher instead of lower but that also makes sense because i don't know any better
391,10_14,msgid2317,0,Train,i mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess,"how much is yellow block, purple block, green block so we have fifty thirty eighty ten hundred hundred and twenty"
392,10_14,msgid2332,1,Train,i mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess,"red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block, mystery block feels same almost try it"
393,10_15,msgid2327,1,Train,well if we're going to put a hundred and ten what no that's what i said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first i think we should go with a hundred and ten first then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right,I think one twenty and one ten would be a good idea because we have two chances
394,10_15,msgid2332,0,Train,well if we're going to put a hundred and ten what no that's what i said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first i think we should go with a hundred and ten first then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right,"red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block, mystery block feels same almost try it"
395,10_15,msgid2337,1,Train,well if we're going to put a hundred and ten what no that's what i said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first i think we should go with a hundred and ten first then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right,"no no no no so the thing is like when you put blue block red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block, mystery block feels almost same because blue block's just ten gram difference that's why let let's try it yeah"
396,10_16,msgid2339,1,Train,like just because of just becasuse that's fibonacci because i'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means,i mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess
397,10_16,msgid2355,1,Train,like just because of just becasuse that's fibonacci because i'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means,ten ten green block is what twenty right one plus one two yup two plus one three yup three plus two five oh yeah yellow block's fifty
398,10_16,msgid2342,1,Train,like just because of just becasuse that's fibonacci because i'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means,well if we're going to put a hundred and ten what no that's what i said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first i think we should go with a hundred and ten first then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right
399,10_17,msgid2362,1,Train,But eighty is a big difference like you know from a hundred to an eighty Well let's try to see if there is a hint here,We don't really have to be correct I mean we're trying to be correct but
400,10_17,msgid2355,0,Train,But eighty is a big difference like you know from a hundred to an eighty Well let's try to see if there is a hint here,ten ten green block is what twenty right one plus one two yup two plus one three yup three plus two five oh yeah yellow block's fifty
401,10_17,msgid2356,1,Train,But eighty is a big difference like you know from a hundred to an eighty Well let's try to see if there is a hint here,and five plus three eight yeah let's go for eighty then that's a pattern that's it
402,10_18,msgid2250,1,Train,Eighty let's let's go for eighty Yeah,and yellow block's fifty
403,10_18,msgid2356,0,Train,Eighty let's let's go for eighty Yeah,and five plus three eight yeah let's go for eighty then that's a pattern that's it
404,10_18,msgid2352,1,Train,Eighty let's let's go for eighty Yeah,wait wait what's two three five eight thirteen twenty eighty yeah that's fibonacci definitely
405,10_19,msgid2365,1,Train,Is that the first mystery block or the second mystery block,mystery block is eight rb i think mystery block mystery block is eighty
406,10_19,msgid2369,1,Train,Is that the first mystery block or the second mystery block,Eighty gram sounds seems like a ninety gram to me but
407,1_1,msgid31,1,Train,what would we maybe put blue block one on there too,yeah ok so now we know that blue block is also ten
408,1_1,msgid1,1,Train,what would we maybe put blue block one on there too,Alright so
409,1_1,msgid32,1,Train,what would we maybe put blue block one on there too,Um ok so now
410,1_3,msgid30,0,Train,and green is twenty ok so which one is blue and which one is purple,"red block, blue block seems pretty balanced"
411,1_3,msgid23,1,Train,and green is twenty ok so which one is blue and which one is purple,Ok
412,1_3,msgid80,1,Train,and green is twenty ok so which one is blue and which one is purple,yo that's close enough ok so
413,1_4,msgid69,1,Train,yes verify real quick but i think purple block is,it's just like slightly
414,1_4,msgid14,1,Train,yes verify real quick but i think purple block is,it's right there
415,1_4,msgid0,1,Train,yes verify real quick but i think purple block is,I just need to calibrate my cameras real quick
416,1_5,msgid65,1,Train,Yes do you want to check real quick,"yeah im thinking that red block, blue block, green block, yellow block, purple block's ten ten twenty thirty"
417,1_5,msgid30,0,Train,Yes do you want to check real quick,"red block, blue block seems pretty balanced"
418,1_5,msgid11,1,Train,Yes do you want to check real quick,And uh as you are filling it out if you guys can fill out the survey you will be group one
419,1_6,msgid111,1,Train,How much was purple thirty,Yeah
420,1_6,msgid51,1,Train,How much was purple thirty,Twenty thirty forty
421,1_6,msgid61,1,Train,How much was purple thirty,how much is the dark blue small one ten
422,1_7,msgid61,0,Train,I almost feel like this one is still heavier,how much is the dark blue small one ten
423,1_7,msgid116,1,Train,I almost feel like this one is still heavier,Purple was thirty
424,1_7,msgid4,1,Train,I almost feel like this one is still heavier,Um and then
425,1_8,msgid28,1,Train,This one feels heavier still add like ten to this side I think,Does the slider move
426,1_8,msgid7,1,Train,This one feels heavier still add like ten to this side I think,So uh
427,1_8,msgid22,1,Train,This one feels heavier still add like ten to this side I think,And you guys will be group one
428,1_9,msgid116,0,Train,It still feels heavier but it could just be,Purple was thirty
429,1_9,msgid39,1,Train,It still feels heavier but it could just be,No  
430,1_9,msgid68,1,Train,It still feels heavier but it could just be,And then we did fifty
431,1_10,msgid29,0,Train,Yeah that feels pretty pretty similar to me and try switching it left hand right hand maybe,Hold on lets just uh
432,1_10,msgid47,1,Train,Yeah that feels pretty pretty similar to me and try switching it left hand right hand maybe,Ooh its looking like thirty
433,1_10,msgid50,1,Train,Yeah that feels pretty pretty similar to me and try switching it left hand right hand maybe,Yeah ten ten twenty thirty
434,1_11,msgid37,1,Train,Two attempts a hundred will it tell us if we get it right or wrong ok,purple block's more
435,1_11,msgid131,1,Train,Two attempts a hundred will it tell us if we get it right or wrong ok,That's a hundred
436,1_11,msgid90,1,Train,Two attempts a hundred will it tell us if we get it right or wrong ok,Yes thirty
437,1_12,msgid115,0,Train,So would you,How much was purple thirty
438,1_12,msgid89,0,Train,So would you,yes verify real quick but i think purple block is
439,1_12,msgid139,1,Train,So would you,Thirty twenty
440,2_1,msgid247,1,Train,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right,and that looks like it might be about even
441,2_1,msgid257,1,Train,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right,Twenty probably
442,2_1,msgid249,1,Train,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right,there we go that's better
443,2_2,msgid235,1,Train,"wait did we mix purple block, green block up or","and i i think red block, blue block are"
444,2_2,msgid237,1,Train,"wait did we mix purple block, green block up or","yeah red block, blue block also just look like relatively the same size but red block, blue block could be different material you know"
445,2_2,msgid225,1,Train,"wait did we mix purple block, green block up or",Using the scale um
446,2_3,msgid270,1,Train,blue or purple,putting purple block on that side checking yellow block one
447,2_3,msgid233,1,Train,blue or purple,so i would imagine if this
448,2_3,msgid273,1,Train,blue or purple,it's leaning towards one side a bit much
449,2_4,msgid241,1,Train,i think purple or,and then if blue block's ten grams then we have a two
450,2_4,msgid247,0,Train,i think purple or,and that looks like it might be about even
451,2_4,msgid257,0,Train,i think purple or,Twenty probably
452,2_5,msgid238,1,Train,wait a mystery block,Even length
453,2_5,msgid294,1,Train,wait a mystery block,Ok yep
454,2_5,msgid268,1,Train,wait a mystery block,Accuracy wise so then you know
455,2_6,msgid243,1,Train,Do you want to give it a shot,Yeah
456,2_6,msgid224,1,Train,Do you want to give it a shot,You are going to determine the rest of the weights using them
457,2_6,msgid220,1,Train,Do you want to give it a shot,So the task you are completing today is called the weights task
458,2_7,msgid308,1,Train,Is the can the weight exceed what's on the paper,That also seems similar
459,2_7,msgid304,1,Train,Is the can the weight exceed what's on the paper,Alright uh we are allowed to use the other blocks in holding the weight
460,2_7,msgid317,1,Train,Is the can the weight exceed what's on the paper,So yeah  
461,2_8,msgid300,1,Train,Is it wrong,For the next part of your task you will determine the weight of this mystery block
462,2_8,msgid337,1,Train,Is it wrong,One forty
463,2_8,msgid228,1,Train,Is it wrong,You guys are going to be group two
464,2_9,msgid237,0,Train,So we can try and,"yeah red block, blue block also just look like relatively the same size but red block, blue block could be different material you know"
465,2_9,msgid317,0,Train,So we can try and,So yeah  
466,2_9,msgid333,1,Train,So we can try and,I was thinking one forty first as well but um
467,2_10,msgid219,1,Train,Were we right then,Callibrate my cameras real quick
468,2_10,msgid282,1,Train,Were we right then,No
469,2_10,msgid336,1,Train,Were we right then,Sorry one fifty since it's on there
470,2_11,msgid322,0,Train,No you're wrong it was eighty,I might shoot all the way for the one forty
471,2_11,msgid373,1,Train,No you're wrong it was eighty,Were we right then
472,2_11,msgid358,1,Train,No you're wrong it was eighty,Because it says think about the relationship between the weights of the power blocks
473,2_12,msgid273,0,Train,And then like every set of two I guess and the next block will be the set,it's leaning towards one side a bit much
474,2_12,msgid287,1,Train,And then like every set of two I guess and the next block will be the set,i think purple or
475,2_12,msgid381,1,Train,And then like every set of two I guess and the next block will be the set,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the
476,2_13,msgid346,1,Train,Least heavy to most heavy or,Yeah
477,2_13,msgid338,1,Train,Least heavy to most heavy or,Yeah
478,2_13,msgid333,0,Train,Least heavy to most heavy or,I was thinking one forty first as well but um
479,3_1,msgid407,1,Train,"so you think red block, blue block're the same weight or",Like it it drops one's probably heavier
480,3_1,msgid405,1,Train,"so you think red block, blue block're the same weight or",You don't need to use the slider or anything 
481,3_1,msgid404,1,Train,"so you think red block, blue block're the same weight or",All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams
482,3_2,msgid425,1,Train,yellow block one feels just a smidge heavier yeah try green block one,the blue one is also ten right
483,3_2,msgid421,1,Train,yellow block one feels just a smidge heavier yeah try green block one,Right here right
484,3_2,msgid429,1,Train,yellow block one feels just a smidge heavier yeah try green block one,the suspense is killing me it takes forever
485,3_4,msgid420,1,Train,wait purple is how much purple was thirty,So the 
486,3_4,msgid408,1,Train,wait purple is how much purple was thirty,Um and then
487,3_4,msgid448,1,Train,wait purple is how much purple was thirty,yeah i mentioned here green is twenty
488,3_5,msgid455,1,Train,"have we tried red block, blue block two and the green one cause it's",wait purple is how much purple was thirty
489,3_5,msgid414,1,Train,"have we tried red block, blue block two and the green one cause it's","so you think red block, blue block're the same weight or"
490,3_5,msgid416,1,Train,"have we tried red block, blue block two and the green one cause it's","i think red block, blue block're the same weight yeah"
491,3_6,msgid440,1,Train,"no so when we try purple block, green block both",i think purple block is more purple-y yeah
492,3_6,msgid459,1,Train,"no so when we try purple block, green block both",Twenty
493,3_6,msgid409,1,Train,"no so when we try purple block, green block both",You will place the cubes on the worksheet where you think they are and you will also record your answers here on this survey here on the computer. You guys will be group three
494,3_7,msgid458,1,Train,"yellow block must be red block, blue block, purple block right because comparing yellow block to forty yellow block's",and green is
495,3_7,msgid447,1,Train,"yellow block must be red block, blue block, purple block right because comparing yellow block to forty yellow block's",it seems to be
496,3_7,msgid420,0,Train,"yellow block must be red block, blue block, purple block right because comparing yellow block to forty yellow block's",So the 
497,3_8,msgid435,1,Train,maybe we should try those things here,So
498,3_8,msgid420,0,Train,maybe we should try those things here,So the 
499,3_8,msgid423,1,Train,maybe we should try those things here,So 
500,3_9,msgid425,0,Train,Is there a way for us to test it other than just our,the blue one is also ten right
501,3_9,msgid408,0,Train,Is there a way for us to test it other than just our,Um and then
502,3_9,msgid456,1,Train,Is there a way for us to test it other than just our,purple is thirty
503,3_10,msgid482,1,Train,I have a question ok somebody like hold the yellow and the brown like,Try what then
504,3_10,msgid499,1,Train,I have a question ok somebody like hold the yellow and the brown like,I bet there's a scale app on our phone and I bet it's cheating to download that
505,3_10,msgid490,1,Train,I have a question ok somebody like hold the yellow and the brown like,Green is twenty purple is thirty and yellow is fifty yeah good
506,3_11,msgid408,0,Train,But like tell me when it starts to feel the same,Um and then
507,3_11,msgid405,0,Train,But like tell me when it starts to feel the same,You don't need to use the slider or anything 
508,3_11,msgid428,1,Train,But like tell me when it starts to feel the same,Um I'm going to see if there's a lighter one
509,3_12,msgid424,1,Train,How do you feel this one is lighter,So
510,3_12,msgid448,0,Train,How do you feel this one is lighter,yeah i mentioned here green is twenty
511,3_12,msgid454,1,Train,How do you feel this one is lighter,Yeah just to confirm
512,3_13,msgid443,1,Train,I feel like this like might be a smidge heavier but,yellow block one feels just a smidge heavier yeah try green block one
513,3_13,msgid485,1,Train,I feel like this like might be a smidge heavier but,Yeah until fifty
514,3_13,msgid405,0,Train,I feel like this like might be a smidge heavier but,You don't need to use the slider or anything 
515,3_14,msgid515,1,Train,Definitely heavier right,But like tell me when it starts to feel the same
516,3_14,msgid510,1,Train,Definitely heavier right,It's not twice as heavy as yellow
517,3_14,msgid415,1,Train,Definitely heavier right,"red block, blue block're still teetering"
518,3_15,msgid503,1,Train,Does uh like heavier objects roll down the incline plane faster,Eighty to ninety
519,3_15,msgid449,1,Train,Does uh like heavier objects roll down the incline plane faster,it's leaning more this side so
520,3_15,msgid524,1,Train,Does uh like heavier objects roll down the incline plane faster,How do you feel this one is lighter
521,3_16,msgid527,1,Train,Does this really heavier than this for sure,I don't know hang on
522,3_16,msgid477,1,Train,Does this really heavier than this for sure,twenty green yeah
523,3_16,msgid523,1,Train,Does this really heavier than this for sure,Yeah yeah try it try it again
524,3_17,msgid518,1,Train,What if,I was trying to take the the visual input out of it
525,3_17,msgid568,1,Train,What if,It's eighty
526,3_17,msgid491,0,Train,What if,Oh fun
527,3_18,msgid534,1,Train,So then theory do we have these positioned the same,I think this is heavier now I was thinking like if you have
528,3_18,msgid541,1,Train,So then theory do we have these positioned the same,I think we would have to have really good measures yeah yeah
529,3_18,msgid530,1,Train,So then theory do we have these positioned the same,Definitely heavier right
530,3_19,msgid576,1,Train,What if you removed the ten,So it's ninety
531,3_19,msgid407,0,Train,What if you removed the ten,Like it it drops one's probably heavier
532,3_19,msgid434,1,Train,What if you removed the ten,i think that's a good guess
533,3_20,msgid501,1,Train,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right,Yeah it could be eighty ninety
534,3_20,msgid583,1,Train,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right,Yes  
535,3_20,msgid534,0,Train,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right,I think this is heavier now I was thinking like if you have
536,3_21,msgid489,1,Train,Yeah it's maybe let's try it with the smaller one then,Ok so for the next part if the test you are going to determine the weight of this block without using the scale to get the answer
537,3_21,msgid529,0,Train,Yeah it's maybe let's try it with the smaller one then,Now I feel like the right side
538,3_21,msgid557,1,Train,Yeah it's maybe let's try it with the smaller one then,So it's still pretty even it's still pretty even
539,3_22,msgid591,0,Train,Do we want to say eighty,If only our block was a little just narrow sliver
540,3_22,msgid449,0,Train,Do we want to say eighty,it's leaning more this side so
541,3_22,msgid533,1,Train,Do we want to say eighty,Ok
542,3_23,msgid424,0,Train,Are we allowed to use,So
543,3_23,msgid527,0,Train,Are we allowed to use,I don't know hang on
544,3_23,msgid492,1,Train,Are we allowed to use,And you can begin now
545,3_24,msgid552,1,Train,Ok so we literally know nothing about the second block this sounds like a Bayesian probability question right,Oops put both at a time maybe
546,3_24,msgid467,1,Train,Ok so we literally know nothing about the second block this sounds like a Bayesian probability question right,yeah green is twenty and purple is thirty
547,3_24,msgid609,1,Train,Ok so we literally know nothing about the second block this sounds like a Bayesian probability question right,Narrow down that like ten gram window
548,3_25,msgid477,0,Train,Every possible weight up to one forty you think so we got ,twenty green yeah
549,3_25,msgid595,1,Train,Every possible weight up to one forty you think so we got ,Yeah but when it but 
550,3_25,msgid514,0,Train,Every possible weight up to one forty you think so we got ,This is heavier I can
551,3_26,msgid556,1,Train,If we just used only two blocks then,Just once remove this block
552,3_26,msgid640,1,Train,If we just used only two blocks then,And we can make it up to one fifty so if we find a block which can make
553,3_26,msgid634,1,Train,If we just used only two blocks then,Like they have two one forty grams
554,6_1,msgid1069,1,Train,Alright let's see if we can find a thirty,i guess if red block red one's ten grams
555,6_1,msgid1071,1,Train,Alright let's see if we can find a thirty,"seems like red block, blue block might be about the same"
556,6_1,msgid1061,1,Train,Alright let's see if we can find a thirty,The task that you will be completing today is called the weights task
557,6_2,msgid1074,1,Train,cause purple block's also a twenty let's double check that purple block's not also a twenty,Too heavy so
558,6_2,msgid1072,1,Train,cause purple block's also a twenty let's double check that purple block's not also a twenty,i would agree yeah so blue block one's ten
559,6_2,msgid1067,1,Train,cause purple block's also a twenty let's double check that purple block's not also a twenty,Um that is on this computer
560,6_3,msgid1062,1,Train,is blue block one a twenty,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of these colorful cubes here
561,6_3,msgid1076,1,Train,is blue block one a twenty,this is a sensitive scale
562,6_3,msgid1085,1,Train,is blue block one a twenty,Well
563,6_4,msgid1097,1,Train,so i would guess the yellow one is gonna be,so big blue is probably thirty
564,6_4,msgid1076,0,Train,so i would guess the yellow one is gonna be,this is a sensitive scale
565,6_4,msgid1082,1,Train,so i would guess the yellow one is gonna be,the purple ish one
566,6_5,msgid1097,0,Train,"yeah purple block, green block's considerably heavier so purple block one did we say purple block was thirty",so big blue is probably thirty
567,6_5,msgid1098,1,Train,"yeah purple block, green block's considerably heavier so purple block one did we say purple block was thirty",Of the weight
568,6_5,msgid1062,0,Train,"yeah purple block, green block's considerably heavier so purple block one did we say purple block was thirty",In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of these colorful cubes here
569,6_6,msgid1084,0,Train,"did we try forty we did try forty because green block one's thirty and then blue block one's or green block one's twenty so purple block, blue block","it's just stuff written at the bottom that's a so red block, green block's a ten and a twenty right now right that's looking"
570,6_6,msgid1075,0,Train,"did we try forty we did try forty because green block one's thirty and then blue block one's or green block one's twenty so purple block, blue block",Way too heavy
571,6_6,msgid1086,0,Train,"did we try forty we did try forty because green block one's thirty and then blue block one's or green block one's twenty so purple block, blue block","red block, blue block, green block, yellow block, purple block're increments of ten i would say that's probably"
572,6_8,msgid1115,1,Train,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be,big blue
573,6_8,msgid1066,1,Train,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be,Um so as you work through the tasks if you can place the cubes on the sheet where they go and also fill out the survey
574,6_8,msgid1082,0,Train,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be,the purple ish one
575,6_9,msgid1102,1,Train,Are we allowed to make our own scales is there rules,Fifty
576,6_9,msgid1088,0,Train,Are we allowed to make our own scales is there rules,cause purple block's also a twenty let's double check that purple block's not also a twenty
577,6_9,msgid1110,1,Train,Are we allowed to make our own scales is there rules,so that's
578,6_10,msgid1130,1,Train,Or are you not allowed to tell us what we are allowed to do,i think purple block one's purple so blue was ten and then purple was thirty
579,6_10,msgid1075,0,Train,Or are you not allowed to tell us what we are allowed to do,Way too heavy
580,6_10,msgid1137,1,Train,Or are you not allowed to tell us what we are allowed to do,Alright guys
581,6_11,msgid1098,0,Train,Which ones twenty this one,Of the weight
582,6_11,msgid1154,1,Train,Which ones twenty this one,More right yeah
583,6_11,msgid1152,1,Train,Which ones twenty this one,We're getting close
584,6_12,msgid1144,1,Train,I think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say,Ok  
585,6_12,msgid1119,1,Train,I think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say,i would say yellow is like forty five but we could say fifty since we're
586,6_12,msgid1121,1,Train,I think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say,forced with these
587,6_13,msgid1063,1,Train,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
588,6_13,msgid1155,1,Train,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up,Yeah maybe one of these
589,6_13,msgid1137,0,Train,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up,Alright guys
590,6_14,msgid1116,1,Train,How much is the yellow one again,"unless she's messing with us and some of red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block are in increments of five"
591,6_14,msgid1124,1,Train,How much is the yellow one again,Have you filled it out on the computer you guys are group six
592,6_14,msgid1158,1,Train,How much is the yellow one again,Yeah
593,6_15,msgid1132,1,Train,Do you know how much the coffee weighs though,Yes
594,6_15,msgid1161,1,Train,Do you know how much the coffee weighs though,Which ones twenty this one
595,6_15,msgid1171,1,Train,Do you know how much the coffee weighs though,Alright so how much do we have here one twenty total
596,6_16,msgid1113,1,Train,I wonder if we can guess it's similar in weight to these three,yeah green and big blue
597,6_16,msgid1103,1,Train,I wonder if we can guess it's similar in weight to these three,Oh maybe not
598,6_16,msgid1192,1,Train,I wonder if we can guess it's similar in weight to these three,I'm I'm good with it it's real heavy
599,6_17,msgid1179,0,Train,What do you guys think that makes sense yeah,Yeah she gives us up to one fifty on our survey
600,6_17,msgid1073,0,Train,What do you guys think that makes sense yeah,Alright let's see if we can find a twenty
601,6_17,msgid1132,0,Train,What do you guys think that makes sense yeah,Yes
602,6_18,msgid1111,1,Train,Are you guys good with eighty,"purple block, green block is fifty on here so then"
603,6_18,msgid1152,0,Train,Are you guys good with eighty,We're getting close
604,6_18,msgid1107,1,Train,Are you guys good with eighty,red and small blue are both ten
605,8_2,msgid1741,1,Train,can i add the red one or blue one here maybe purple block might be thirty,Ok so now
606,8_2,msgid1745,1,Train,can i add the red one or blue one here maybe purple block might be thirty,it's ok
607,8_2,msgid1744,1,Train,can i add the red one or blue one here maybe purple block might be thirty,Sorry
608,8_3,msgid1744,0,Train,did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might,Sorry
609,8_3,msgid1747,1,Train,did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might,Cause yeah
610,8_3,msgid1745,0,Train,did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might,it's ok
611,8_4,msgid1755,1,Train,let's try both the green ones now i mean both the big ones yeah,did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might
612,8_4,msgid1745,0,Train,let's try both the green ones now i mean both the big ones yeah,it's ok
613,8_4,msgid1757,1,Train,let's try both the green ones now i mean both the big ones yeah,Oh I thought ok 
614,8_5,msgid1780,1,Train,But which one was thirty I'm just,oh yellow block's more than forty
615,8_5,msgid1770,1,Train,But which one was thirty I'm just,yeah i feel that way
616,8_5,msgid1781,1,Train,But which one was thirty I'm just,So let's see the weights we know
617,8_6,msgid1790,1,Train,Like can we use a combination of,yellow block is more than forty
618,8_6,msgid1777,1,Train,Like can we use a combination of,"red block, purple block's too light and we know that green is equal to"
619,8_6,msgid1740,0,Train,Like can we use a combination of,yeah green is for twenty
620,8_7,msgid1777,0,Train,"so we can move one of red block, blue block, purple block","red block, purple block's too light and we know that green is equal to"
621,8_7,msgid1742,0,Train,"so we can move one of red block, blue block, purple block","i'll just take red block, blue block off and then we can have a little more"
622,8_7,msgid1751,1,Train,"so we can move one of red block, blue block, purple block",yeah so the blue one is thirty
623,8_8,msgid1739,0,Train,we know yellow block's between forty and fifty we can't really,or is green block
624,8_8,msgid1798,1,Train,we know yellow block's between forty and fifty we can't really,Fifty so heavy or
625,8_8,msgid1759,1,Train,we know yellow block's between forty and fifty we can't really,let's try both the green ones now i mean both the big ones yeah
626,8_9,msgid1795,1,Train,directly compare yellow block um,Forty
627,8_9,msgid1793,0,Train,directly compare yellow block um,Twenty plus ten thirty
628,8_9,msgid1794,1,Train,directly compare yellow block um,Thirty  
629,8_10,msgid1772,0,Train,where should we put yellow block then in forty,green green is twenty so green is twenty and then we said purple block one is thirty right
630,8_10,msgid1802,1,Train,where should we put yellow block then in forty,Like can we use a combination of
631,8_10,msgid1766,1,Train,where should we put yellow block then in forty,cause that's going to be pushing that way
632,8_11,msgid1788,1,Train,presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure yellow block accurately,Yeah twenty  
633,8_11,msgid1749,1,Train,presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure yellow block accurately,Yeah  
634,8_11,msgid1816,1,Train,presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure yellow block accurately,so yellow block's forty one
635,8_12,msgid1808,1,Train,wait so is green block just in the wrong place or is green block the twenty,We can add weight
636,8_12,msgid1815,1,Train,wait so is green block just in the wrong place or is green block the twenty,Yeah
637,8_12,msgid1741,0,Train,wait so is green block just in the wrong place or is green block the twenty,Ok so now
638,8_14,msgid1780,0,Train,would you agree with that,oh yellow block's more than forty
639,8_14,msgid1782,1,Train,would you agree with that,Between forty and fifty
640,8_14,msgid1827,1,Train,would you agree with that,Yeah forty nine yeah
641,8_15,msgid1758,1,Train,Should we be precise to one gram,And keep the thirty
642,8_15,msgid1831,1,Train,Should we be precise to one gram,would you agree with that
643,8_15,msgid1811,1,Train,Should we be precise to one gram,directly compare yellow block um
644,8_16,msgid1801,0,Train,So you want to just like tell me the numbers cause,yeah yellow block is between forty and fifty
645,8_16,msgid1835,1,Train,So you want to just like tell me the numbers cause,No  
646,8_16,msgid1780,0,Train,So you want to just like tell me the numbers cause,oh yellow block's more than forty
647,8_17,msgid1792,1,Train,yeah and and um what's the other one blue blue is ten,Yeah
648,8_17,msgid1822,0,Train,yeah and and um what's the other one blue blue is ten,wait so is green block just in the wrong place or is green block the twenty
649,8_17,msgid1816,0,Train,yeah and and um what's the other one blue blue is ten,so yellow block's forty one
650,8_18,msgid1795,0,Train,mystery block,Forty
651,8_18,msgid1842,1,Train,mystery block,Close
652,8_18,msgid1755,0,Train,mystery block,did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might
653,8_19,msgid1767,1,Train,Is there any mystery block third weight,"gotcha are red block, blue block, purple block, yellow block centered"
654,8_19,msgid1741,0,Train,Is there any mystery block third weight,Ok so now
655,8_19,msgid1799,0,Train,Is there any mystery block third weight,Fifty is too heavy
656,8_20,msgid1882,1,Train,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference,Gotcha  
657,8_20,msgid1788,0,Train,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference,Yeah twenty  
658,8_20,msgid1834,1,Train,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference,Have you filled out the survey on the computer as well and you guys will be 
659,8_21,msgid1856,0,Train,Want me to add the green,White block
660,8_21,msgid1873,1,Train,Want me to add the green,To see you know how to 
661,8_21,msgid1741,0,Train,Want me to add the green,Ok so now
662,8_22,msgid1744,0,Train,A way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel,Sorry
663,8_22,msgid1891,1,Train,A way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel,Yeah I guess yeah
664,8_22,msgid1857,1,Train,A way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel,mystery block
665,8_23,msgid1895,1,Train,Are they the same size though,Want me to add the green
666,8_23,msgid1893,0,Train,Are they the same size though,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference
667,8_23,msgid1743,1,Train,Are they the same size though,fine grained control oh
668,8_25,msgid1806,1,Train,So it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple,Yeah but
669,8_25,msgid1794,0,Train,So it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple,Thirty  
670,8_25,msgid1779,1,Train,So it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple,so let's try blue block one too
671,8_26,msgid1951,1,Train,Ninety let's see are we good with ninety,Green  
672,8_26,msgid1741,0,Train,Ninety let's see are we good with ninety,Ok so now
673,8_26,msgid1855,1,Train,Ninety let's see are we good with ninety,Ok which way
674,8_27,msgid1908,1,Train,Is it the second mystery block,Ok
675,8_27,msgid1754,1,Train,Is it the second mystery block,so purple block's thirty here
676,8_27,msgid1862,1,Train,Is it the second mystery block,Ok so it might have to do with the numbers and stuff but
677,8_28,msgid1760,1,Train,A second mystery block so I'm just wondering which two are moving about,Let's try
678,8_28,msgid1786,1,Train,A second mystery block so I'm just wondering which two are moving about,purple block is thirty green block is twenty
679,8_28,msgid1842,0,Train,A second mystery block so I'm just wondering which two are moving about,Close
680,8_29,msgid1854,1,Train,We don't have a mystery block the company forgot to send the block when you do estimate what the mystery block's weight was without knowing,um green is twenty yep and then yellow
681,8_29,msgid1841,1,Train,We don't have a mystery block the company forgot to send the block when you do estimate what the mystery block's weight was without knowing,yeah we just got stumped cause it was like
682,8_29,msgid1906,1,Train,We don't have a mystery block the company forgot to send the block when you do estimate what the mystery block's weight was without knowing,A way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel
683,8_30,msgid1844,1,Train,What do you think,Yeah
684,8_30,msgid1786,0,Train,What do you think,purple block is thirty green block is twenty
685,8_30,msgid1804,0,Train,What do you think,we tried all of the combinations yeah yeah we can try this
686,8_31,msgid1837,0,Train,For like each new block,Should we be precise to one gram
687,8_31,msgid1833,1,Train,For like each new block,Yeah
688,8_31,msgid1995,0,Train,For like each new block,A second mystery block so I'm just wondering which two are moving about
689,9_1,msgid2064,1,Train,I don't know if I trust you,"i would say red block, blue block's equal"
690,9_1,msgid2082,1,Train,I don't know if I trust you,Oh yeah ok oh never mind ok 
691,9_1,msgid2061,1,Train,I don't know if I trust you,Let's go
692,9_2,msgid2106,1,Train,What it's eighty grams I feel like it's ,No the yellow one is the heaviest
693,9_2,msgid2112,1,Train,What it's eighty grams I feel like it's ,So one forty
694,9_2,msgid2116,1,Train,What it's eighty grams I feel like it's ,Ok so it's either one forty and one fifty ok
695,9_3,msgid2125,1,Train,Like no shot this is eighty grams,Eighty that's not right it's
696,9_3,msgid2126,1,Train,Like no shot this is eighty grams,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
697,9_3,msgid2116,0,Train,Like no shot this is eighty grams,Ok so it's either one forty and one fifty ok
698,10_1,msgid2173,1,Train,let's assume that the bigger ones are,You must place the cubes onto this worksheet once you have determined their weight and also enter their weight in the survey on the computer
699,10_1,msgid2170,1,Train,let's assume that the bigger ones are,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
700,10_1,msgid2169,1,Train,let's assume that the bigger ones are,In part one you will work together to determine the weights of the five colorful cubes
701,10_2,msgid2181,1,Train,"i mean what why didn't we first check out whether red block, blue block two are equal red block, blue block are of equal size but",we can put red block other one here too
702,10_2,msgid2168,1,Train,"i mean what why didn't we first check out whether red block, blue block two are equal red block, blue block are of equal size but",Okay The test that you are completing today is called the weights test The test that you are completing today is called the weights test
703,10_2,msgid2170,0,Train,"i mean what why didn't we first check out whether red block, blue block two are equal red block, blue block are of equal size but",I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
704,10_4,msgid2222,1,Train,"do green block, purple block, yellow block make sense",Thirty one thirty two so thirty
705,10_4,msgid2191,1,Train,"do green block, purple block, yellow block make sense",Yeah I suppose
706,10_4,msgid2170,0,Train,"do green block, purple block, yellow block make sense",I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
707,10_5,msgid2171,1,Train,Do you wanna try any tens anywhere,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale here
708,10_5,msgid2180,0,Train,Do you wanna try any tens anywhere,let's put two yeah red one as well
709,10_5,msgid2169,0,Train,Do you wanna try any tens anywhere,In part one you will work together to determine the weights of the five colorful cubes
710,10_6,msgid2224,1,Train,"like if green block, purple block are more than fifty then yellow block is less yeah",um you know what let's try this
711,10_6,msgid2229,1,Train,"like if green block, purple block are more than fifty then yellow block is less yeah",Twenty
712,10_6,msgid2179,0,Train,"like if green block, purple block are more than fifty then yellow block is less yeah",let's assume that the bigger ones are
713,10_7,msgid2176,0,Train,should i oh yeah yellow block is fifty grams,Yeah
714,10_7,msgid2198,1,Train,should i oh yeah yellow block is fifty grams,Looks fairly equal to me yeah
715,10_7,msgid2177,1,Train,should i oh yeah yellow block is fifty grams,Okay  
716,10_8,msgid2165,1,Train,"you know what like i feel that is blue block, red block what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right",Let me Calibrate my cameras real quick Oh I'm just
717,10_8,msgid2252,1,Train,"you know what like i feel that is blue block, red block what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right",tens yeah so that's it
718,10_8,msgid2195,1,Train,"you know what like i feel that is blue block, red block what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right",just a sec let it settle for the
719,10_9,msgid2178,1,Train,where is the mystery block any idea,So I suppose like
720,10_9,msgid2197,1,Train,where is the mystery block any idea,Hmmm
721,10_9,msgid2253,1,Train,where is the mystery block any idea,Hopefully
722,10_10,msgid2214,1,Train,indicate the weight of the mystery block whoa where is the blue guy,like you would be able to see it right?
723,10_10,msgid2203,1,Train,indicate the weight of the mystery block whoa where is the blue guy,Let's put one ten
724,10_10,msgid2241,0,Train,indicate the weight of the mystery block whoa where is the blue guy,"like if green block, purple block are more than fifty then yellow block is less yeah"
725,10_11,msgid2222,0,Train,"i would say still heavier than all mystery block blocks yeah can you grab there and hold red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block",Thirty one thirty two so thirty
726,10_11,msgid2292,1,Train,"i would say still heavier than all mystery block blocks yeah can you grab there and hold red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block",well just just try to get a feel of mystery block
727,10_11,msgid2291,1,Train,"i would say still heavier than all mystery block blocks yeah can you grab there and hold red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block",can we form something on one side like this place the other one so okay yeah
728,10_12,msgid2187,1,Train,"because two tens two tens there's two so the thing is like if we put yellow block, purple block, green block, red block also feels lighter right","i mean what why didn't we first check out whether red block, blue block two are equal red block, blue block are of equal size but"
729,10_12,msgid2308,1,Train,"because two tens two tens there's two so the thing is like if we put yellow block, purple block, green block, red block also feels lighter right",Yeah
730,10_12,msgid2240,1,Train,"because two tens two tens there's two so the thing is like if we put yellow block, purple block, green block, red block also feels lighter right",Fifty
731,10_13,msgid2280,1,Train,"red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block, mystery block feels same almost try it",where is the mystery block any idea
732,10_13,msgid2328,1,Train,"red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block, mystery block feels same almost try it",Yeah
733,10_13,msgid2307,1,Train,"red block, blue block, green block, purple block, yellow block, mystery block feels same almost try it",Still lighter
734,10_14,msgid2289,1,Train,i mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess,Thirty Twenty
735,10_14,msgid2303,1,Train,i mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess,Fifty thirty eighty twenty hundred
736,10_14,msgid2172,1,Train,i mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess,All of the weights are intervals of ten grams so you don't need to use the slider um and the scale is not perfect so as long as one side doesn't drop you can assume the weights are fairly equal
737,10_15,msgid2285,1,Train,well if we're going to put a hundred and ten what no that's what i said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first i think we should go with a hundred and ten first then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right,Um you guys will have two attempts to enter the data correctly into the survey
738,10_15,msgid2305,1,Train,well if we're going to put a hundred and ten what no that's what i said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first i think we should go with a hundred and ten first then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right,this is hard to say
739,10_15,msgid2175,1,Train,well if we're going to put a hundred and ten what no that's what i said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first i think we should go with a hundred and ten first then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right,okay so the red is ten grams?
740,10_16,msgid2291,0,Train,like just because of just becasuse that's fibonacci because i'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means,can we form something on one side like this place the other one so okay yeah
741,10_16,msgid2322,1,Train,like just because of just becasuse that's fibonacci because i'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means,"yeah yellow block, purple block, green block, red block's lighter but yellow block, purple block, green block, red block, blue block"
742,10_16,msgid2312,1,Train,like just because of just becasuse that's fibonacci because i'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means,Let me try
743,10_17,msgid2226,1,Train,But eighty is a big difference like you know from a hundred to an eighty Well let's try to see if there is a hint here,Okay  
744,10_17,msgid2357,1,Train,But eighty is a big difference like you know from a hundred to an eighty Well let's try to see if there is a hint here,like just because of just becasuse that's fibonacci because i'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means
745,10_17,msgid2237,0,Train,But eighty is a big difference like you know from a hundred to an eighty Well let's try to see if there is a hint here,just a sec let this settle now yeah
746,10_18,msgid2239,1,Train,Eighty let's let's go for eighty Yeah,yellow block is like less than fifty less than fifty
747,10_18,msgid2330,0,Train,Eighty let's let's go for eighty Yeah,i i was thinking maybe a little bit higher instead of lower but that also makes sense because i don't know any better
748,10_18,msgid2243,1,Train,Eighty let's let's go for eighty Yeah,i guess we're done huh i just want to feel yellow block though i really want to see if yellow block's the heaviest
749,10_19,msgid2284,1,Train,Is that the first mystery block or the second mystery block,Determine the weight of this mystery block 
750,10_19,msgid2292,0,Train,Is that the first mystery block or the second mystery block,well just just try to get a feel of mystery block
751,10_19,msgid2216,1,Train,Is that the first mystery block or the second mystery block,Stop now please
